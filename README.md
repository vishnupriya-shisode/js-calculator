## JavaScript Calculator

A simple calculator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to practice core JavaScript concepts and DOM manipulation.

### What this project does
- Performs basic arithmetic operations: add, subtract, multiply, divide
- Displays numbers and results dynamically on the page
- Uses button click events to trigger calculations

### What I learned
- Working with JavaScript variables and functions
- Using `document.getElementById` to access and update the DOM
- Handling user interactions with `onclick` events
- Updating UI content dynamically using `textContent`


This project was built as a hands-on exercise to strengthen my JavaScript fundamentals.
